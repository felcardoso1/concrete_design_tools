> follow the instructions at @prompt for

∴ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to "follow the instructions at @prompt for" but the message seems incomplete. They haven't specified what I should do or what @prompt refers to.

  Looking at the system reminders, I can see:
  1. My todo list is empty
  2. There's a CLAUDE.md file with instructions about being a Reinforced Concrete Design Assistant with specialized CLI tools

  The user's message appears cut off - "follow the instructions at @prompt for" doesn't complete the thought.

  I should ask the user to clarify what they want me to do. However, I should also acknowledge the context from CLAUDE.md if relevant.

  Since the message is incomplete, I should ask for clarification in a helpful way.

                                                                                                                                                                 12:28 PM  claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

  Could you please complete your request? For example:
  - What task would you like me to help with?
  - Are you looking to design a reinforced concrete element (beam, column, etc.)?
  - Do you have specific structural engineering calculations you need?

  Based on the context, I can help you with reinforced concrete design using the available tools (flexao.exe, cisalhamento.exe, flexo_compressao.exe, etc.) according to NBR 6118. Just let me know what you need!

  ⎿  Read prompt for opencode.md (24 lines)

∴ Thinking…

  Great! Now I have the full context. The user wants me to:

  1. Design a floor beam (B1) for bending and shear
  2. Design a column (C1) for axial load + bending
  3. Optimize the beam if needed (compare 20x50 vs 20x55)

  They also mention I should read the CLAUDE.md (which I already have in context) and SKILLS.md file.

  Let me:
  1. First read the SKILLS.md to understand the detailed tool parameters
  2. Create a todo list for this structural design task
  3. Then perform the calculations systematically

  This is a multi-step task that would benefit from a todo list.

● Perfect! I'll help you design these reinforced concrete elements. Let me first read the SKILLS.md file to understand the detailed tool parameters, then I'll work through each element systematically.                                                                         12:29 PM  claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

∴ Thinking…

  Great! I've read the SKILLS.md file and created a todo list. Now I need to work through the structural design calculations systematically.

  Let me start by calculating the design loads for beam B1:

  Beam B1:
  - Span L = 6 m
  - Dead load (g) = 8 kN/m
  - Live load (q) = 5 kN/m
  - Total characteristic load: wk = g + q = 8 + 5 = 13 kN/m
  - For design, we use factored loads: wd = 1.4 × wk = 1.4 × 13 = 18.2 kN/m
  - Maximum moment (simply supported): Mk = (wk × L²) / 8 = (13 × 6²) / 8 = (13 × 36) / 8 = 58.5 kN.m
  - Maximum shear: Vk = (wk × L) / 2 = (13 × 6) / 2 = 39 kN

  Now I'll calculate these values and start the design process.

  Actually, looking at the loads more carefully, the tools use characteristic loads (Mk, Vk), so I should use:
  - Mk = 58.5 kN.m
  - Vk = 39 kN

  The tools internally apply the load factor (gamaf = 1.4 by default).

  Let me proceed with the first todo item.

● Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. Let me work through this structural design systematically.                                                                                                                                                                     12:29 PM  claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

∴ Thinking…

  Now let me calculate the loads for beam B1:

  Beam B1 (simply supported, L = 6 m):
  - Dead load: g = 8 kN/m
  - Live load: q = 5 kN/m
  - Total characteristic load: wk = 8 + 5 = 13 kN/m

  Maximum moment (at mid-span):
  Mk = (wk × L²) / 8 = (13 × 6²) / 8 = (13 × 36) / 8 = 468 / 8 = 58.5 kN.m

  Maximum shear (at supports):
  Vk = (wk × L) / 2 = (13 × 6) / 2 = 78 / 2 = 39 kN

  Now I'll move to the next step of designing for bending.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       12:29 PM  claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

  For the simply supported beam (L = 6.0 m):
  - Total characteristic load: wk = 8 + 5 = 13 kN/m
  - Maximum moment: Mk = (wk × L²) / 8 = (13 × 6²) / 8 = 58.5 kN.m
  - Maximum shear: Vk = (wk × L) / 2 = (13 × 6) / 2 = 39 kN

     Verificacao: OK
     ============================================

∴ Thinking…

  Excellent! The beam design for bending is successful:- As = 4.40 cm² (tensile reinforcement)
  - As' = 0.00 cm² (no compression reinforcement needed)
  - Domain 2 (ductile - good!)
  - Reinforcement ratio = 0.44% (well within the normal range of 0.5-2%)

  This is a very economical design. Now let me design for shear and then move on to the other tasks.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                            12:33 PM  claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

     Verificacao: OK - Armadura minima
     ============================================

∴ Thinking…

  Perfect! The shear design is also successful:- Asw = 2.05 cm²/m (stirrup area per meter)
  - The design is governed by minimum reinforcement (which is good - means the shear stress is low)
  - Shear stress (0.59 MPa) is much lower than the ultimate capacity (4.34 MPa) - very safe

  Now let me design the column C1.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            12:34 PM  claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

     Dominio:                    3

     Verificacao: OK - Armadura minima
     ============================================

∴ Thinking…

  Perfect! The column design is complete:- Calculated As = 0.21 cm² (very small)
  - Minimum As = 5.00 cm² (code requirement)
  - Adopt Asmin = 5.00 cm² (minimum reinforcement governs)
  - Domain 3 (typical for columns - good)This indicates that the column is lightly loaded relative to its size, so the code minimum reinforcement governs. This is common and acceptable.

  Now let me check the optimization question - whether we need to compare the 20x50cm vs 20x55cm for the beam. Since the reinforcement ratio for the 20x50cm section was only 0.44% (much less than 3%), we don't need to increase the section height. But let me still do the comparison to show the user how the
  optimization works.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        12:34 PM  claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
  - Calculated As = 0.21 cm² (very small - column is lightly loaded)
  - Minimum As = 5.00 cm² (NBR 6118 requirement governs)
  - Adopt As = 5.00 cm²
  - Domain 3 (typical for columns)

  ⎿  Comparison of beam sections (20cm width):

     h=55cm (d=51cm) → As=3.91 cm², ρ=0.3553%

∴ Thinking…

  Perfect! The optimization comparison shows:- 20x50cm: As = 4.40 cm², ρ = 0.44%
  - 20x55cm: As = 3.91 cm², ρ = 0.36%Since the 20x50cm section has a reinforcement ratio of only 0.44% (much less than the 3% mentioned in the user's question), there's NO need to increase the section height. The 20x50cm section is already very economical.

  Now let me complete the final todo and provide a comprehensive summary with all the design results and recommendations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              12:34 PM  claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
  - 20x50cm: As = 4.40 cm², ρ = 0.44% ✓
  - 20x55cm: As = 3.91 cm², ρ = 0.36%

  Since the 20x50cm section has only 0.44% reinforcement (far below the 3% concern), no increase is needed. The original section is already very economical!

∴ Thinking…

  Now I'll provide a comprehensive summary of all results and recommendations for the user.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              12:35 PM  claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

  ✓ 3. OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS - NO CHANGE NEEDED

  Your concern: Reinforcement ratio > 3%?
