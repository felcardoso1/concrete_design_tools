Thinking: I need to follow the instructions in CLAUDE.md and SKILLS.md. First, I should read SKILLS.md to understand the tools and their usage. Let me read it
→ Read SKILLS.md 
Thinking: Now I need to help the user with their structural design. First, let me check if the tools are available in the directory. Let's list .exe files.
# List available structural engineering tools
$ ls *.exe
cisalhamento.exe
flexao.exe
flexao_verif.exe
flexaot.exe
flexo_compressao.exe
flexo_tracao.exe
torcao.exe
Thinking: Great, all tools are present. Now I need to address the three tasks.
1. Floor Beam B1: Simply supported span 6m, dead load 8 kN/m, live load 5 kN/m. Section 20cm wide, 50cm height. fck=25 MPa, fyk=500 MPa. Check bending and shear.
First, compute the design loads. According to NBR 6118, we need to use load factors. The default factors are 1.4 for dead load and 1.4 for live load (since variable). However, the tools already apply partial safety factors internally (default 1.4). The user gave characteristic loads. The tools expect characteristic moments and shear forces (Mk and Vk). So we need to compute the characteristic moment and shear from characteristic loads.
Simply supported beam with uniform load w_k = dead + live = 8 + 5 = 13 kN/m. Max moment = w_k * L^2 / 8 = 13 * 6^2 / 8 = 13 * 36 / 8 = 13 * 4.5 = 58.5 kN.m. Max shear = w_k * L / 2 = 13 * 6 / 2 = 39 kN.
But wait: For shear design, we need shear force at support. Actually, the design shear force for stirrup design is at distance d from support. However, for simplicity, we can use maximum shear at support. The tool likely expects characteristic shear force Vk. We'll use Vk = 39 kN.
Now, effective depth d: Assume cover 3-4 cm, let's assume d = h - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46 cm.
Now we can run flexao.exe for bending and cisalhamento.exe for shear.
Let's run flexao.exe with parameters: bw=20, h=50, d=46, fck=25, fyk=500, mk=58.5. Let's do it.
# Calculate bending reinforcement for beam B1
$ flexao.exe --bw=20 --h=50 --d=46 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --mk=58.5
/usr/bin/bash: flexao.exe: command not found
Thinking: We're on Windows, need to run .exe directly. Probably need to prefix with .\ or just call .exe. Let's try .\flexao.exe.
# Calculate bending reinforcement for beam B1
$ .\flexao.exe --bw=20 --h=50 --d=46 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --mk=58.5
/usr/bin/bash: .flexao.exe: command not found
Thinking: Hmm, maybe we need to run without dot? Actually, bash on Windows may not find .exe. Let's try using cmd? We can run via bash with ./flexao.exe? Let's see current directory. Let's try using absolute path? Let's first check where we are.
# Print working directory
$ pwd
/c/Sandbox
Thinking: We're in a bash environment (probably git bash). The .exe files are Windows executables. We can run them directly as flexao.exe (without dot). Let's try just "flexao.exe". Maybe need to add .exe extension. Let's try with ./flexao.exe? Let's see if they are executable. Let's try using wine? Actually, they are Windows executables compiled for Windows, but we're in a bash shell that can run Windows executables. Usually you can just call flexao.exe. The error says command not found, meaning it's not in PATH. We can run them from current directory using ./flexao.exe. Let's try that.
# Run flexao.exe with ./ prefix
$ ./flexao.exe --bw=20 --h=50 --d=46 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --mk=58.5
As=4.40 As'=0.00 dominio=2 rho=0.44
Thinking: Great! So we have bending results: As = 4.40 cm², As' = 0.00 cm², domain 2 (good), reinforcement ratio ρ = 0.44%.
Now we need to check shear. Use cisalhamento.exe with bw=20, d=46, fck=25, fyk=500, vk=39. Let's run.
# Calculate shear reinforcement for beam B1
$ ./cisalhamento.exe --bw=20 --d=46 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --vk=39
Asw=2.05 twd=0.5935 twu=4.3393 [OK__Armadura_minima]
Thinking: Result: Asw = 2.05 cm²/m (stirrup area per meter), twd = 0.5935 MPa (design shear stress), twu = 4.3393 MPa (ultimate shear stress), status OK with minimum reinforcement.
Now we need to check if section works. Both bending and shear seem okay. Domain 2 is ductile, shear minimum reinforcement. The reinforcement ratio is low (0.44%), which is fine.
Now we need to consider optimization question: If beam B1 needs too much reinforcement (>3% ratio). Currently ratio is 0.44% << 3%. So section 20x50 is adequate. But the user asks: if >3%, can we use 20x55 section? Let's still compute for 20x55 to compare steel requirements.
But first, we need to compute the design moment and shear with load factors? Actually the tools already apply safety factors internally. The user gave characteristic loads; we used characteristic moment and shear. That's correct.
Now column C1: Axial load Nk = 600 kN, bending moment Mk = 85 kNm, section 25x50 cm, cover 3.5 cm. Use flexo_compressao.exe. Parameters: bw=25, h=50, dl=cover distance? According to SKILLS.md, dl is cover distance to reinforcement (typically 3-4 cm). For column design, dl is distance to reinforcement (cover). They said cover 3.5 cm. We'll use dl=3.5. However, note that d = h - dl? Actually effective depth is not needed for column design? The tool uses dl to compute effective depth? Not sure. Let's use as described.
Run flexo_compressao.exe with --nk=600, --mk=85, --fck=25, --fyk=500. Let's do it.
# Calculate column reinforcement for column C1
$ ./flexo_compressao.exe --bw=25 --h=50 --dl=3.5 --nk=600 --mk=85 --fck=25 --fyk=500
As=0.21 Asmin=5.00 dominio=3 [OK__Armadura_minima]
Thinking: Interesting: As = 0.21 cm² (calculated steel area) but Asmin = 5.00 cm² (minimum steel area per NBR 6118 for columns). Status: OK with minimum reinforcement, domain 3 (balanced). So we need to adopt Asmin = 5.00 cm².
Now we need to check if the column section is adequate. Since minimum reinforcement governs, the column is lightly loaded. That's fine.
Now optimization question: compare steel requirements for beam B1 with 20x55 section. Let's compute bending and shear for 20x55. Effective depth d = h - 4 = 55 - 4 = 51 cm. Moment and shear same loads (characteristic). Run flexao.exe with h=55, d=51. Let's do it
# Calculate bending reinforcement for beam B1 with 20x55 section
$ ./flexao.exe --bw=20 --h=55 --d=51 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --mk=58.5
As=3.91 As'=0.00 dominio=2 rho=0.36
Thinking: As = 3.91 cm² (slightly less). Ratio 0.36%. So taller beam reduces steel requirement.
Now shear for 20x55: d=51, vk=39. Let's compute.
# Calculate shear reinforcement for beam B1 with 20x55 section
$ ./cisalhamento.exe --bw=20 --d=51 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --vk=39
Asw=2.05 twd=0.5353 twu=4.3393 [OK__Armadura_minima]
Thinking: Asw = 2.05 cm²/m (same, minimum). So both sections work.
Now we need to present results and answer user questions.
Let's also consider that the beam may need to be checked for deflection and cracking, but that's beyond scope.
Now I'll create a summary.
But before finalizing, maybe we should double-check if the load factors are applied correctly. According to SKILLS.md, tools apply default safety factors (γc=1.4, γs=1.15, γf=1.4). That means they take characteristic Mk and Vk and apply γf = 1.4 to get design loads. So we used characteristic Mk = 58.5 kN.m, which is correct.
Now we can present results.
Let's also compute reinforcement ratio for beam: ρ = As/(bwd) = 4.40/(2046) = 0.00478 = 0.478% (tool gave 0.44% maybe because As is in cm² and bwd in cm²? Actually ratio is As/(bwd) *100% maybe? Let's trust tool.
Now we need to answer user: trial sections are adequate.
Now I'll write a concise answer. Use engineering interpretation.
Let's also check if domain is okay: domain 2 is ductile, good.
Now I'll output results. Use bullet points. Provide reinforcement details.
We can also mention that for beam B1, we can adopt 4φ12.5mm bars (area = 4 * 1.227 = 4.91 cm²) which is slightly higher than required 4.40 cm². Stirrups: φ5mm c/20cm? Need to compute stirrup spacing. But maybe not needed.
Let's compute minimum stirrup area: According to NBR 6118, minimum stirrup area is ρsw,min = 0.2% of bw per meter? Actually formula in SKILLS.md mentions aswmin. We can get from cisalhamento with verbose? Let's run cisalhamento with verbose to see aswmin. Let's do it for first case.
# Get detailed shear results including minimum stirrup area
$ ./cisalhamento.exe --bw=20 --d=46 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --vk=39 --verbose
============================================
  CISALHAMENTO - NBR 6118
============================================
Armadura de cisalhamento (Asw):     2.05 cm2/m
Tensao de cisalhamento (twd):     0.5935 MPa
Tensao ultima (twu):              4.3393 MPa
Contribuicao do concreto (tc):    0.7695 MPa
Armadura minima (Asw,min):          2.05 cm2/m
Verificacao: OK - Armadura minima
============================================
Thinking: So minimum stirrup area is 2.05 cm²/m, which matches required. So we can use stirrups φ5mm c/20cm? Let's compute: area of one stirrup (two legs) for φ5mm: 2 * 0.196 = 0.392 cm². Spacing s = (Asw * 100) / (asw per m)? Actually Asw is cm² per meter. For φ5mm stirrup area per meter = (0.392 * 100) / s. Solve s = (0.392 * 100) / 2.05 = 39.2 / 2.05 ≈ 19.1 cm. So φ5mm c/19cm (max spacing limited to 0.6*d = 27.6 cm). OK.
Now column: Asmin = 5.00 cm². Use 4φ12.5mm = 4 * 1.227 = 4.91 cm², slightly less. Might need 4φ12.5 + 2φ? But minimum is 5.00 cm², so we can use 4φ12.5 (4.91) still acceptable? Usually minimum is 5.00, need at least that. Could use 4φ12.5 + 2φ5? Better to use 4φ12.5mm and check if As adopted = 4.91 < 5.0? The tool says Asadopt = max(As, Asmin) = 5.00. So we need to adopt at least 5.00 cm². So we can use 4φ12.5 (4.91) plus maybe a small extra bar, or use 4φ12.5mm with slightly larger diameter? Actually 4φ12.5mm area is 4.91 cm², close enough; but code requires minimum of 5.00 cm². Might be okay with 4φ12.5mm? Let's not overthink.
Now we need to answer the user. Let's create a summary.
I'll write a concise response with results. Use engineering language. Provide recommendations.
Now let's produce final answer.
Beam B1 (20×50 cm, 6 m span)
Loads: wₖ = 8 + 5 = 13 kN/m  
Characteristic moment: Mₖ = wₖ·L²/8 = 13·36/8 = 58.5 kN·m  
Characteristic shear: Vₖ = wₖ·L/2 = 13·6/2 = 39 kN
Bending design (flexao.exe):
flexao.exe --bw=20 --h=50 --d=46 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --mk=58.5
Result: As=4.40 As'=0.00 dominio=2 rho=0.44
- Required tensile steel: 4.40 cm² (no compression steel)
- Domain 2 → ductile failure (good)
- Reinforcement ratio: 0.44% (well below 3% limit)
Shear design (cisalhamento.exe):
cisalhamento.exe --bw=20 --d=46 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --vk=39
Result: Asw=2.05 twd=0.5935 twu=4.3393 [OK__Armadura_minima]
- Required stirrups: 2.05 cm²/m (minimum governs)
- Design shear stress: 0.59 MPa < ultimate 4.34 MPa
- Section adequate for shear
Practical reinforcement proposal:
- Longitudinal: 4φ12.5 mm (4.91 cm²) – satisfies 4.40 cm²
- Stirrups: φ5 mm c/19 cm (2.05 cm²/m) – max spacing 0.6·d ≈ 27 cm
---
Column C1 (25×50 cm, cover 3.5 cm)
Axial load: Nₖ = 600 kN  
Bending moment: Mₖ = 85 kN·m
Column design (flexo_compressao.exe):
flexo_compressao.exe --bw=25 --h=50 --dl=3.5 --nk=600 --mk=85 --fck=25 --fyk=500
Result: As=0.21 Asmin=5.00 dominio=3 [OK__Armadura_minima]
- Calculated steel: 0.21 cm²
- Minimum steel governs: 5.00 cm²
- Domain 3 → balanced failure (typical for columns)
- Section adequate – lightly loaded
Practical reinforcement proposal:
- Minimum: 5.00 cm² → adopt 4φ12.5 mm (4.91 cm²) + 1φ6.3 mm (0.31 cm²) = 5.22 cm²  
  (or use 4φ12.5 mm if local code allows rounding)
---
Optimization – Beam B1 with 20×55 cm section
Bending (h=55 cm, d=51 cm):
flexao.exe --bw=20 --h=55 --d=51 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --mk=58.5
Result: As=3.91 As'=0.00 dominio=2 rho=0.36
- Steel reduction: 4.40 → 3.91 cm² (‑11%)
- Reinforcement ratio: 0.36% (even lower)
Shear (d=51 cm):
cisalhamento.exe --bw=20 --d=51 --fck=25 --fyk=500 --vk=39
Result: Asw=2.05 twd=0.5353 twu=4.3393 [OK__Armadura_minima]
- Same minimum stirrups (2.05 cm²/m)
Comparison: Both sections are adequate; the 20×55 cm beam uses slightly less longitudinal steel but same stirrups.

Summary
| Element | Trial Section | Reinforcement Required | Status |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|--------|
| Beam B1 | 20×50 cm | As = 4.40 cm², Asw = 2.05 cm²/m | ✅ Adequate (domain 2, shear OK) |
| Column C1 | 25×50 cm | Asₘᵢₙ = 5.00 cm² | ✅ Adequate (minimum steel governs) |
| Beam B1 (alt) | 20×55 cm | As = 3.91 cm², Asw = 2.05 cm²/m | ✅ Slightly more economical |
Recommendations:
1. Beam B1: 20×50 cm section is sufficient; adopt 4φ12.5 mm longitudinal bars and φ5 mm stirrups c/19 cm.
2. Column C1: 25×50 cm section works; provide at least 5.00 cm² longitudinal steel (e.g., 4φ12.5 mm + 1φ6.3 mm).
3. Optimization: Switching to 20×55 cm reduces longitudinal steel by 11% – consider if architectural constraints allow.
Both trial sections are structurally adequate according to NBR 6118.
