I'm designing a reinforced concrete structure for a small building. I need help with 
the following elements:

1. **Floor Beam B1**: 
   - Simply supported span of 6 meters
   - Dead load: 8 kN/m, Live load: 5 kN/m
   - Section: 20cm wide, trying 50cm height
   - Materials: fck=25 MPa, fyk=500 MPa
   - Check if this section works for both bending and shear

2. **Column C1** (supporting the beam):
   - Axial load from slabs above: Nk = 600 kN
   - Bending moment from beam eccentricity: Mk = 85 kNm
   - Trying a 25x50cm section
   - Same materials (fck=25 MPa, fyk=500 MPa)
   - Cover: 3.5 cm

3. **Optimization question**: 
   - If beam B1 needs too much reinforcement (>3% ratio), can we use a 20x55cm 
     section instead? Compare the steel requirements.

Can you help me calculate the required reinforcement for each element and tell me 
if my trial sections are adequate?
